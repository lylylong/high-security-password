# High Security Password

## Description

My working system often needs to update with high-security passwords. Randomly passwords can help me protect my working files, so I am using this password generator all the time.

This High-Security Password Generator has a very simple user interface and user experience:

- By clicking the red button "Generate Password", a window pops up and tells you to input a number between 8 & 128, which will be your new password's length.
- After that, you can pick your password types, if you need to include special characters, numbers, lower case letters, or uppercase letters, just by selecting "OK" or "Cancel". You'll get your new password in seconds!
- If you input the wrong information, don't worry, the system will tell you why your input is not been processed. You can click that red button "Generate Password" to start again.
